 * absence removes the affordance, the way a missing `onCreate` removes the
 * profile tile rather than a flag greying it out.
 *
 * The point is that a feature written once appears in both clients. A check for
 * "am I in the desktop app" would put that back the other way round — every new
 * feature needing a branch per shell, which is the divergence this exists to
 * end.
 *
 * These contracts are the half that does not differ. Each shell writes its own
