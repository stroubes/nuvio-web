 * lands — is a separate storage container, signed out and knowing nothing. So
 * the player's callback is pointed at a small service instead, which is the
 * first thing in the chain that ever sees the number, and the app collects it
 * from there on waking.
 *
 * Optional in every sense: with no relay configured the callbacks work as
 * before and the prompt asks. See worker/README.md.
